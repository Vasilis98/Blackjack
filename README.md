# Blackjack Game

## Description

This project is an interactive **Blackjack** game built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The user can play a round of Blackjack, with the game automatically calculating the sum of the cards and desplaying guidance and result messages.

### How to Play:

- **Start**: The user sees the message *"Want to play a round?"* and by clicking the **START GAME** button, is is automatically dealt two cards.
- **Draw a Card**: After the message **"Do you want to draw a new card?"** appears, the user can click the **NEW CARD** button to draw an additional card.
- **Sum Calculation**: Each time the user draws new cars, the current card total is displayed below.
- **Final Outcome**:
    -If the total of the cards is exactly **21** the message **"You have got Blackjack!"** appears.
    -If the total exceeds **21** the message **"You are out of the game"** appears.
- **Game Reset**: By pressing the **RESET GAME** button, the user can reset the game and start a new round.

## Technologies

This project was developed with the following technologies:
- **HTML** for the structure of the user interface.
- **CSS** for styling and design.
- **JavaScript** for game logic and interactivity.

## Improvement Goals

In future versions of this project, the following features could be added:
- **Competition with the Computer**: Adding a computer opponent so that the user competes to get closer to 21 without going over.
-  **Smarter Dealer Logic**: Introducing a strategy for the dealer/computer, with rules for when to stand and when to draw a new card.
-  **Multiple Rounds and Scoring**: Adding a function to track scores over multiple rounds, allowing users to see their total score in a game session.
-  **Sounds and Animation Effects**: Adding sounds and animations to enhance the user experience.
